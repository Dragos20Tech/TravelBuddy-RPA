# Travel Buddy Robot

This is a university project that I built as my last lab assignment.  Unfortunately, I did not use GIT for this project. However, following instructions from [Mukesh
Kala's project-based course](https://youtu.be/0dprUuqe0vU), I created a robot that scrapes data from a specific web page to enable users to check ticket prices for 
travel to certain destinations. During the development of this project, I faced several issues. I have corrected some errors, but not all. One issue that I was unable
to resolve is allowing the user to choose when they would like to travel using this robot. Unfortunately, it didn't work because of the VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface)
, robotâ€™s ability to see selectors on a webpage or computer interface.

## How it works

To use the robot, simply provide your starting location or **origin**, followed by your desired **destination**. Finally, provide your **email address** to receive
ticket prices and information.
